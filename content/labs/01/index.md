**Due on Gradescope at 11:59p Sunday 6/27**

The first lab introduces you to the main technology we'll be using in the course: R, RStudio, and RMarkdown. We'll also do some brief analysis of a cool dataset by one John Arbuthnot. 

If you have difficulty with this assignment, we can help! Please come to office hours or post to the class forum.
