# First Things First

## Clarification of Submission Format

-   At this point in class, we went over a demo of how we expect labs to be submitted. This was first done in RStudio, and then in Gradescope.

-   The main points are that:

    -   labs *must be knitted from .Rmd directly to .pdf*. This means we do not want people knitting to .html and converting to .pdf.

    -   answers must be tagged to their corresponding pages of your submission *completely* and *correctly*.

. . .

## Clarification of Submission Format

-   For the second lab, we will have two additional questions, each worth one point, which verify that you have done these two steps.

-   We will also be contacting those who have collaborated with others and have not written their acknowledgement sentences as stated on the course syllabus starting from the second lab forward.

. . .

## Office Hours

-   Office hours begin today!

-   Great resource to visit if you need any help with the course content or just want to chat about your academic career and interests, etc.

-   All in-person office hours currently in Evans 323.

. . .

## Ed

-   Now on the Ed dates is a schedule of staff dates for manning the forum

-   We will check in periodically throughout the day

# Recap

1.  Descriptive

2.  Generalizations

3.  Causal

4.  Predictive

. . .

## The Four Types of Claim

-   This week we will be focusing on *Descriptive Claims*!

# Descriptive Claims

## Descriptive Claims

-   **Descriptive Claims** generally focus around claims made either with summary statistics or graphics of data.

-   They are important because oftentimes they serve as a first step toward making the other three types of claim we will study

-   Today we will focus on descriptive claims made using numerical data

## It's just like before

-   Remember last week, we noted that:

>   The exact question you want to answer completely determines what your data set will look like.

-   When it comes to picking a summary tool, we have a similar story:

>   The composition of your data set and the variables within it should help guide what summary tool you should use.

## NBA Champions 

-   The Golden State Warriors just won their fourth NBA championship in seven years!

-   In honor of this accomplishment, we will be using a dataset from the 2021-2022 NBA season which compiles player statistics per game throughout the week.
