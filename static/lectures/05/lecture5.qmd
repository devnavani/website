# First Things First

## Lab Update

1.  Lab 1 deadline moved to Tuesday, June 28 at 11:59pm

2.  Lab 2 deadline *remains* Sunday, July 3 at 11:59pm

. . .

## Clarification of Submission Format

-   At this point in class, we went over a demo of how we expect labs to be submitted. This was first done in RStudio, and then in Gradescope.

-   The main points are that:

    -   labs *must be knitted from .Rmd directly to .pdf*. This means we do not want people knitting to .html and converting to .pdf.

    -   answers must be tagged to their corresponding pages of your submission *completely* and *correctly*.

. . .

## Clarification of Submission Format

-   For the second lab, we will have two additional questions, each worth one point, which verify that you have done these two steps.

-   We will also be contacting those who have collaborated with others and have not written their acknowledgement sentences as stated on the course syllabus starting from the second lab forward.

. . .

## On Yesterday's Lecture

-   A data wrangling step I missed!

-   At this point we went to the course server and discussed a level of a categorical variable in the `NBA` dataset we used yesterday that I should have accounted for.

-   The maximum/minimum *can* be an outlier in the box plot framework.

    -   Check IMS Ch 5 for details. 
    
# Recap

## The Four Types of Claim

1.  Descriptive

2.  Generalizations

3.  Causal

4.  Predictive

-   This week we are looking at *Descriptive Claims*!

. . .

## The two types of summary

## NBA Champions

-   The Golden State Warriors just won their fourth NBA championship in seven years!

-   In honor of this accomplishment, we will be using a dataset from the 2021-2022 NBA season which compiles player statistics per game throughout the week.

-   The unit of observation is a player.

-   The dataset comes from *Basketball Reference* and can be found [here](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2022_per_game.html).

# Summaries of Categorical Data

# Numerical Summaries of Categorical Data

## Numerical Summaries of Categorical Data

1.  Counts and proportions

2.  Mode

-   We will focus *mostly* on item 1 today.

-   We are introducing numerical summaries first today rather than graphical because they will connect naturally to the graphical summaries in the categorical case.

. . .

## Contingency Tables

-   **Used for:** Two categorical variables

-   **Desiderata**: We want to show the interplay between two categorical variables.

. . .

. . .

## Contingency Tables

-   Example:

> Make a contingency table involving the ages of NBA players and their position (either "Center" or "Small Forward")

. . .

At this point we went to the board, and then to the course server to work on making this table.

. . .

## Contingency Tables: Proportions

-   There are three types of proportions we can get from a contingency table.

1.  **Marginal**

2.  **Joint**

3.  **Conditional**

. . .

## Contingency Tables: Types of Proportions

1.  **Marginal** - How to get it:

    1.  Pick a row/column you are interested in.
    
    2. Total up the number of observations in that row or a column 
    3. divide by the total amount of observations in the table.
    
. . .

2.  **Joint** - How to get it:

    1. Pick a cell of the table you are interested in. 
    
    2. Count the number of observations in that cell.
    
    3. Divide by the total amount of observations in a table.
    
. . . 

## Contingency Tables: Joint Proportions

## Contingency Tables: Types of Proportions

3.  **Conditional** - How to get it:

    1.  Pick a column/row you are interested in. 
    
    2.  Cover the other column/row. 
    
    3.  Count the number of observations in one cell of the row/column.
    
    4. Divide by the total number of observations in both cells of the row/column.

. . .

## Contingency Tables: Conditional Proportions {.scrollable}

![](images/contingency-conditional-proportions.png)

. . .

## Contingency Tables: Proportions - Exercise

-   The NBA table we made can be found in lecture5.Rmd on the Lecture Code Thread.

-   Exercise:

    -   Find the proportion of players who are thirty and older and play center.

    -   Among those players who are thirty and older, find the proportion of those who play center. 

    -   Find the proportion of players who play center.

# Graphical Summaries of Categorical Data

## Graphical Summaries of Categorical Data

-   The bar chart!

    -   There are four different types of bar charts we will discuss.

        -   Bar chart for one categorical variable

        -   For two categorical variables:

            -   stacked bar chart

            -   side-by-side bar chart

            -   stacked, normalized bar chart

. . .

## Bar Chart

-   **Used for:** One or two categorical variables

-   **Desiderata**: We want to plot the distrbution of one (or two) categorical variables.

. . .

## Bar chart for one categorical variable

> Visualize the distribution of positions of NBA Players in the 2021-2022 season.

. . .

```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(rvest)
library(tidyverse)

url <- "https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2022_per_game.html#per_game_stats"

NBA <- (read_html(url) %>% html_table())[[1]] %>% filter(Tm != "Tm") %>% filter(Tm != "TOT")
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
ggplot(NBA %>% distinct(Player, .keep_all = TRUE)) + geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = Pos),
                       color = "red", fill = "black") +
  xlab("Positions") + 
  ggtitle("Distribution of Positions of NBA Players",
          subtitle = "2021-2022 Season") + theme_light() 
```

. . .

## Stacked Bar Chart

-   **Used for:** Two categorical variables

-   **Desiderata**: We want to preserve the original look of a bar chart for one categorical variable, but want to divide each bar into levels of another categorical variable.

. . .

## Stacked Bar Chart

> Visualize the distribution of positions of NBA Players in the 2021-2022 season. Stack each bar by age group.

. . .

```{r}
#I will assume the player's youngest age if they played on different teams.

NBA %>% distinct(Player, .keep_all = TRUE) %>%
  mutate(`Over 30?` = (Age > 30)) %>% 
ggplot() + geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = Pos, fill = `Over 30?`),
                    color = "black") +
  xlab("Positions") + ylab("Count") + 
  ggtitle("Distribution of Positions of NBA Players",
          subtitle = "2021-2022 Season") + theme_light()

```

. . .

## Side-by-side Bar Chart

-   **Used for:** Two categorical variables

-   **Desiderata**: We want to preserve the data of a bar chart for one categorical variable, but split it into side-by-side bars for each level of a second categorical variable.

. . .

## Side-by-side Bar Chart

> Visualize the distribution of positions of NBA Players in the 2021-2022 season. For each bar, split by age group.

. . .

```{r}
NBA %>% distinct(Player, .keep_all = TRUE) %>%
  mutate(`Over 30?` = (Age > 30)) %>% 
ggplot() + geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = Pos, fill = `Over 30?`),
                    position = "dodge",
                    color = "black") +
  xlab("Positions") + ylab("Count") + 
  ggtitle("Distribution of Positions of NBA Players",
          subtitle = "2021-2022 Season") + theme_light()

```

. . .

## Stacked, Normalized Bar Chart

-   **Used for:** Two categorical variables

-   **Desiderata**: We want to interpret conditional proportions visually.

. . .

## Stacked, Normalized Bar Chart

> Visualize the distribution of positions of NBA Players in the 2021-2022 season. For each bar, stack by the conditional proportions of Age Group.

. . .

```{r}
NBA %>% distinct(Player, .keep_all = TRUE) %>%
  mutate(`Over 30?` = (Age > 30)) %>% 
ggplot() + geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = Pos, fill = `Over 30?`),
                    position = "fill",
                    color = "black") +
  xlab("Positions") + ylab("Conditional Proportion") +
  ggtitle("Distribution of Positions of NBA Players",
          subtitle = "2021-2022 Season") + theme_light()

```

# Measures of Spread (for numerical variables)

## Measures of Spread

-   Here are the measures of spread we will cover.

1.  Sample Variance

    1.  Sample Standard Deviation
    
2.  Median Absolute Deviation (MAD)

3.  IQR

4.  Range

. . . 

## Sample Variance $s^2$

-   **Used on:** One numerical variable

-   **Desiderata**: We want a measure of spread which will incorporate all observations of a variable.

-   **Mathematical Formula**: 

    -   Let $x_i$ be each observation of the variable $x$.

    -   $$s^2: \quad \frac{1}{n - 1}\sum_{i = 1}^n (x_i - \bar{x})^2$$
    
-   Very useful, but what about the square?

. . .

## Sample Standard Deviation $s$

-   **Used on:** One numerical variable

-   **Desiderata**: We want a measure of spread which will incorporate all observations of a variable *and is in the same units as those observations.*

-   **Mathematical Formula**: 

    -   Let $x_i$ be each observation of the variable $x$.
    
    -   $$s^2: \quad \sqrt{\frac{1}{n - 1}\sum_{i = 1}^n (x_i - \bar{x})^2}$$

. . .

## Median Absolute Deviation 

-   **Used on:** One numerical variable

-   **Desiderata**: We want a measure of spread which will incorporate all observations of a variable and is in the same units as those observations. Additionally, *we wish to sacrifice a little bit of precision in exchange for being robust to extreme values*.

-   **Mathematical Formula**:
  
    -   Let $x_i$ be each observation of the variable $x$.
    
    -   $$MAD: \quad \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i = 1}^n |x_i - \bar{x}| $$
    
. . . 

## Range

-   **Used on:** One numerical variables

-   **Desiderata**: We want a measure of spread that is easy to calculate and interpret.

-   **Mathematical Formula**:  $$\textrm{range} =  max - min$$
    
. . . 

## Interquartile Range (IQR)

-   **Used on:** One numerical variables

-   **Desiderata**: We want a measure of spread that is easy to calculate and is focused on calculating the variability of a typical observation. Therefore, it will be resistant to outliers.

-   **Mathematical Formula**:  

    -   Let $Q_3$ denote the **75th percentile of the data**.
    
    -   Let $Q_1$ denote the **25th percentile of the data**.

    -   $$\textrm{IQR:} \quad Q_3 - Q_1$$

    
. . . 

## Measures of Spread

-   Example: The distribution of ages of NBA Players in the 2021-2022 Season.

. . . 

```{r, echo = FALSE}
ggplot(NBA %>% distinct(Player, .keep_all = TRUE)) + geom_histogram(mapping = aes(x = as.numeric(Age)),
                             color  = "red", fill = "black",
                           binwidth = 2) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(from = 19, to = 43, by = 2)) +
  xlab("Age") + ylab("Count") +
  ggtitle("Ages of NBA Players", subtitle = "2021-2022 Season") +
  theme_light(base_size = 15)

```
  
```{r, echo = FALSE}
NBA %>% distinct(Player, .keep_all = TRUE) %>% 
  mutate(Age = as.numeric(Age)) %>%
  summarise(Variance = var(Age),
            SD = sd(Age),
            IQR = IQR(Age),
            MAD = mad(Age)) 

```

. . .

## Shapes of Distributions

> The composition of your data set and the variables within it should help guide what summary tool you should use.

. . . 

-   Indeed, the shape of a variable's distribution helps guide us to an appropriate measures of centers/spread.

. . . 

# Moving forward

## 

![](images/billboard.png)

. . . 

This was made from the `billboard` data-set included in R!

. . . 

## Moving forward

-   Tomorrow and Thursday, we will be discussing data visualization with `ggplot()`!

-   We will see some plot types you have already seen (box plot, etc.) and some new ones, too.

-   This is one of the coolest and most artistic portions of the course!
