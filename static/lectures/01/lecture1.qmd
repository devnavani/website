### Reading Materials (They're mostly free!)

-   There is no outright required reading material, but we do draw concepts from the following texts:

-   Reading will be provided with each lecture on the course website.

-   **Main Text**:

    -   [Introduction to Modern Statistics](https://openintro-ims.netlify.app), Ã‡etinkaya-Rundel and Hardin
    -   Can be accessed here, downloaded as a PDF or ordered in print

-   For supplementary texts, see the course syllabus.

### Programming/Coding 

We will be using what I have termed **"The Big Three"**.

1.  **R** - a programming language designed with statisticians in mind

2.  **RStudio** - a nice "wrapper software" that you will be writing R code in

    1.  <https://stat20.datahub.berkeley.edu>

    2.  Perhaps on your own computer (install R, then RStudio)

3.  **RMarkdown** - a very useful document format that works like Microsoft Word but also can include R code chunks

    1.  You will write your labs /problem sets in RMarkdown, and then *knit* them to a PDF format for submission / completion.

. . .

### Programming/Coding

**Note:** These tools are *not* only useful or the purposes of this course. They are widely used for data analysis in the industry and beyond. *Do not view them as an isolated sandbox!*

. . .

## Berkeley Summer Sessions Stat 20

-   Labs: 50%

    -   all labs weighted equally

-   Midterm: 20%

-   Final: 20% (subject to be a project instead)

-   Quiz 1: 5%

-   Quiz 2: 5%

-   Problem sets: 0%

-   There is **no curve**.

. . .

## Berkeley Summer Sessions Stat 20

-   The *course week* is the window in which we discuss a particular subtopic within the course.

-   It generally begins **Monday 12:00a** and ends **Sun 11:59p**

-   All assignments will be released at the beginning of the course week and will be due at the end of the course week.

. . .

# Assignment Breakdown

## Labs

-   There will be 6 lab assignments, including this week

-   They are the *main assignment in the course*

-   Labs generally center around working with one data set

-   They are released on **Monday 12:00a** and due **Sunday 11:59p**

-   **No late work accepted.** See the course Syllabus for drop/extension policies.

. . .

## Problem Sets

-   There will be 6 problem sets, including this week

-   They generally read more like a traditional homework

-   They are practice and so *will not be graded*

    -   You can consider them to be study material for quizzes/exams

-   They are released on **Monday 12:00a**

-   A video walkthrough solution will be posted to bCourses a week after their releases

. . .

## Quizzes

-   There will be 2 quizzes, one in Week 3 and one in Week 7

-   These are meant to help you prepare for the exams

-   You have 25 minutes to complete them once you start

-   There will be an **original** and a **retake**

    -   The original will be available from **Thursday 6:00p** to **Friday 5:59p**. The answers will be released immediately after.

    -   The retake will be available from **Saturday 6:00p** to **Sunday 5:59p**

-   So one day to review between the original and the retake.

-   Quizzes are an individual assignment (**no collaboration allowed**)

    -   Of course, you may study with others to prepare for the retake.

. . .

## Exams

-   The Midterm takes place **in-class Thursday, July 14**.

-   The Final/Project Presentation takes place **in-class Wednesday, August 10**.

-   80 minutes to complete

-   There *will* be a clobber policy. See syllabus for details.

. . .

# Collaboration policy

## Collaboration

-   Taken from the syllabus:

    -   \*You are encouraged to collaborate with your fellow students on problem sets and labs, but the labs you turn in should reflect your own understanding and all of your collaborators must be cited (first and last name) in a full sentence before the first question on your lab.\*

    -   Example: I collaborated with Qinqyi Fang, Dev Navani and Wayne Wang on this assignment.

    -   \*Please make sure your collaborators have **added you as well in their sentence**. Also, your quiz and test submissions must reflect only your work.\*

. . .

## Collaboration

-   This means, in a nutshell:

    -   For labs: **you need to cite everything that doesn't come out of your own brain or from STAT 20 Summer 2022 course material**, and that **you cannot copy and paste entire solutions to a problem or subproblem on a lab that don't come from either your own brain or from STAT 20 Summer 2022 course material**.

    -   **This includes Internet sources**.

-   Also,

    -   For quizzes, **no collaboration with other people or Internet sources**.

    -   For exams, **no collaboration with other people or Internet sources**.

. . .

## Collaboration

-   If you have any questions about the boundary of the policy, please ask.

-   For more details on what is allowed and what is not, see the course syllabus.

# Introduction

## Course Goals:

After taking this course, you will be able to:

1.  Construct and critique claims made using data.

2.  Perform analysis on a data set in a semi-formal setting.

## Critiquing a claim

![](images/dos.jpg)

. . .

-   What does it mean to be "The World's #2 card game?"

    -   Exercise

-   If we assume it means "The World's #2 best selling card game:"

    -   Exercise: What data could we collect to prove or disprove this statement?

## Critiquing a claim {.scrollable}

. . .

![](images/dostruth.jpeg)

. . .

-   It was (as of June 19) the #13 best seller in card games at Walmart.

-   It wasn't even *on* the first few pages of the Target best sellers list.

## Critiquing a claim

-   At this point we drew a dataset on the board. It had two columns (store name and best selling rank).

-   Now let's come up with a sensible *statistic* from this data that might help us prove or disprove the DOS claim.

. . .

## Critiquing a claim

-   What statistic might make sense?

    -   Exercise

-   What would we expect the value of this statistic to be in a world where DOS actually was the 2nd best selling card game?

    -   Exercise

## Constructing a claim

-   What was the goal of the Chancellor's survey?

    -   Exercise

-   What kind of data would you need to collect to determine the level of support that UC Berkeley students have toward the People's Park project?.

    -   Exercise

## Constructing a claim

![](images/surveyresultsemail.jpg)

-   The survey is linked [here](https://chancellor.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/uc_berkeley_institutional_housing_qual5678-0716-institutionalhousing.pdf)

## Constructing a claim

-   We then performed a demo in an RMarkdown on how to obtain some of the numbers cited in the survey from the actual (namely, the percent margins between support and oppose, before and after participants knew the information about the People's Park project) data-set.

-   The details of the code are not necessary for you to know right now. The main takeaway is that **being able to do statistics on real-world data sets** and **communicating your results clearly and attractively** are the skills that we really want you to get out of the course!
