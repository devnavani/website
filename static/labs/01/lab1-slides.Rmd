## Stat 20 Lab
.pull-left[
**Who**: 25-30 students + GSI

**What**: applying the concepts from lecture by working with real data sets 

**When**: Monday, Wednesday, Thursday afternoons; 50 minutes  

**Where**: Evans Hall 342  
]
--

.pull-right[

**Why**: Doing statistics on a data set requires a synthesis of conceptual frameworks, ideas and notation from mathematics, computation tools, and an understanding of the context of the data itself. It's a complex task and it requires practice.  

**How**: 
-   Groupwork and boardwork
-   Coding with R

]

---

## Icebreaker

1.  Get into groups of 4. Introduce yourselves with names, preferred pronouns, and hometowns.

2. Come up with *two truths and a lie*! Everyone guess each others' lies.

3.  Post your lie to an Ed forum we will create. It will be titled "[Your Section Number] Ed Practice"

---
## Lab 1 Goals

In completing this lab:

-   **Conceptually**, you will learn to:

    -   Identify the unit of observation in a data set
    -   Identify variables in a data set using the Taxonomy of Data

--

-  **Technincally**, you will be learn to:

    -   Use RMarkdown to compose documents with both images and R code
    -   Create vectors in R using `c()` and data frames using `tibble()`
    -   Explore a data set using some `dplyr` functions

# Question One

Go ahead and visit [stat20.datahub.berkeley.edu](stat20.datahub.berkeley.edu)!
---
## The Big Three of Stat 20
1. R
  -   A programming language designed with statisticians in mind
  
--

2. RStudio
  -   A nice "wrapper" software to write R code in
  -   You can open an RStudio session by visiting [stat20.datahub.berkeley.edu](stat20.datahub.berkeley.edu)!
  
--

3. RMarkdown (.Rmd files)
  - A useful document format which combines standard word processing with R code chunks
  - To submit your labs, you will compose a .Rmd file, *knit* it to a PDF, and then submit
  
--
  
---
## The Components of RStudio

RStudio separates itself into four blocks, or *panes*. 

-  You will work most of the time in the **editor**, which is the top-left pane and the one which is most prominent on the screen. This is where you can compose .R and .Rmd files.

--

-  If you want to run R commands without a file, use the **console**, the bottom-left pane. Begin typing at the `>` and press enter to run your command.

---
## The Components of RStudio

-  When you make **objects** or load in **data frames**, they will appear in the top-right pane called the **environment.**

--

- Finally, the bottom-right pane is called the **file directory**. This is where all the files in your DataHub appear-- both the ones you make in RStudio and the ones you upload (a sketch of a data set, for example). 

---
## Running your first line of code
-  Open a new R script. This is a file that contains R code. 
  -   File -> New File -> R Script

--

-  Write a simple command. R is at its core a calculator. How about 5 + 3?

--

-  Select the entire line of code with your cursor. To run the code, either:
  -   Click the *"Run" Button* in the top right corner of the edtior
  -   *Control + Enter* on a Windows computer 
  -   *Command + Enter* on a Mac

--

-  Once you do this, you should see the result (8) pop up in the console!

---
## What can R do?

- We have seen that R can add with `+`. R can also subtract with `-`, multiply with `*`, and divide with `/`.

- R can also work with words, or *character strings*.

--

```{r, echo = TRUE}
"Jeremy"
```

---
## Exercise

- R follows the order of operations! Get back into your same groups of 3-5. You will be assigned one of these mathematical expressions. Come up with the R code to write it. You are free to consult any sources you need. 

1.  the quantity 5 multiplied by 2, raised to the power of 3, plus 1
  - The answer should be 1001   
  
2.  5 multipiled by the quantity 2 raised to the power 3, plus 1
  - The answer should be 41

- Then go ahead and write your group's answer somewhere on the board! 

---
## What can R do?

- What if we want to store a number or a character string? We use `<-`.

--

```{r, echo = TRUE}
favorite_number <- 20
favorite_number
```

--

```{r, echo = TRUE}
favorite_word <- "statistics"
favorite_word
```

--

- We call `favorite_number` and `favorite_word` **objects** that store a *value*.
- We call `<-` the **assignment operator**.
  - We would say that `20` was **assigned** to the **object** `favorite_number`.

---
## What can R do?

- What if I want to store multiple numbers or words at a time? We use `c()`.

- `c` is for["concatenate"](https://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803095630306), which means to link things together end to end in a chain!

```{r, echo = TRUE}
favorite_numbers <- c(20, 21, 22, 23)
favorite_numbers
```


```{r, echo = TRUE}
course_staff <- c("Jeremy", "Wayne", "Qingyi", "Dev")
course_staff
```

---
## What can R do?

-   **Vectors** are a fundamental building block of data in R and here are some things we can do with them.

-   For numeric vectors, we can use built-in R functions to calculate statistics.

--

```{r, echo = TRUE}
jeremys_graduation_years <- c(2013, 2017, 2021, 2022)
mean(jeremys_graduation_years) #returns the average
sum(jeremys_graduation_years)  #returns the total
```


---
## What can R do?

- R can also store data sets. We call data sets in R **data frames**.

--

- We can either load existing data sets or we can make them from scratch.

---
## What can R do?

- Loading existing data sets (such as `iris`, a data set included in R)

--

```{r, echo = TRUE, message = FALSE}
#head prints the first six rows of the data set by default
head(iris)
```

---
## What can R do?

- Making data frames from scratch with `tibble()`!

--

```{r, echo = TRUE, message = FALSE}
#what is this library business?
library(tidyverse) 

course_staff <- c("Jeremy", "Wayne", "Qingyi", "Dev")
favorite_numbers <- c(20, 21, 22, 23)

first_data_frame <- tibble(course_staff, favorite_numbers)

#Renaming the columns of our data frame with a new name vector!
names(first_data_frame) <- c("Staff", "Numbers")

first_data_frame
```

---
## What can R do (with help)?

-   Lastly, what did `library(tidyverse)` do in the last slide?

--

-   `tibble()` is a function in a **package** called `dplyr`, which itself is a part of the `tidyverse` **library**

--

-   **Packages** (and the **libraries** they are sometimes inside of), offer extra functionality that doesn't come with the base installation of R

---
## What can R do (with help)?

-   Because the packages don't come automatically, we have to *load them in* (just once) using `library(PACKAGE_NAME_HERE)`

--

-   We will be using a few different libraries/packages this semester!

    -   The `tidyverse` library
    
--

        -   The `dplyr` package for data analysis and wrangling
--
        
        -   The `ggplot2` package for data visualization
--

    -   The `stat20data` package includes data sets we will use
--

    -   The `infer` package for inferential statistics
  
---
## Question 1

With all of this in hand, you should be able to finish Question 1 now and be prepared for the remainder of the lab!

---

# End of Day 1

---

# Day 2 

Welcome back! Get into groups of 3-5.

----

## Questions 2 and 3

---

# Question 2

---

## First, some background.

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("images/arbuthnot-portrait.png")
```


---

## Arbuthnot

.pull-left[
**Who**: John Arbuthnot, Scottish mathematician/physician  
**When**: 1710  
**Where**: London, England  
**Why**: Try to determine the ratio of the sexes of children at birth; i.e. what is the chance that a newly born child is female?  
**How**: Collecting christening records from all of the parish churches in London.
]

.pull-right[
```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("images/thames.png")
```
]

---
## What is a christening record?
--

A Christening is a ceremony/rite in the Church of England where:

1. The parents bring their new born child to a priest at the church.

--

2. As part of the ceremony, the parents give a first name to the child before the child is baptized (inducted into the church).

--

3. The name of the child and their parents are recorded in a ledger.

--

John Arbuthnot tabulated the total count of names in each year that were traditionally female and male names.

---
```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("images/christening-records.png")
```

---
```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("images/christening-records-zoom.png")
```

---

## Question 2a (3 mins) 

a.    What do you believe the probability of a child being born female is? Provide the evidence/reasoning you used to form your opinion.

---

## Embedding Images in RMarkdown

-   Upload your image by clicking on the *Upload* button

    -   Near the yellow up-arrow in the file directory (bottom right pane)
    
--
    
-   Go to the visual editor and click on the blue portrait icon

--

-   Browse for your file, then click OK

--- 
## Question 2b (10 mins)

b.    Provide a sketch (upload your drawing) of what you believe Arbuthnot's finished data set might look like. Sketch five example rows. Where appropriate, you can (and should) make up values. Make sure you label your columns. Once you are done, have one representative from your group come to the board and draw your sketch. We will go over them together.
      
---

## Question 2c-d (5 mins)

c.    What does each row in your data set correspond to?

d.    What are the data types of each column according to the Taxonomy of Data?

---

## Question 2e (5 mins)

e.    Now, with R code, construct a *data frame* based off the data set you have sketched. Save the final data frame into an object called `my_arbuthnot`.

---

# Question 3

---

## Question 3

Now, we will be reviewing the  `dplyr` functions `mutate()`, `select()`
and `arrange()`. Using these will comprise the bulk of the work for this question.

---

## Question 3

-   `mutate()`: Used to create a new variable from existing variables

    -   This week, your mutations will be mathematical operations on exisiting columns
    
    -   Example: mutate(MY_DATASET, VAR_C = VAR_B - VAR_A)

--
    
-   `select()`: Used to extract a column(s) from a data frame.

    -   Example: select(MY_DATASET, VAR_C, VAR_B, ...)
    
---
## Question 3

-   `arrange()`: Used to sort numerical variables by increasing or decreasing order; variables coded in English by alphabetical order

    -   Example: arrange(MY_DATASET, by = VAR_C)

    -   You would use `by = desc(VAR_C)` within the `arrange()` command to get descending order
    
---

## Questions 3b-d (17 mins)

b.    Which year saw the *most* number of boys christened?

c.    Which year saw the *least* number of *children* christened?

d.    What was the proportion of girl names christened in 1694? Please round to three decimal places.
