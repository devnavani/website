# Lab: Arbuthnot
### Introduction to Probability and Statistics

Welcome!

---
## The Goal of Lab Session

- Best way to make progress on these assignments

- You likely will need to work outside of class to finish the assignment

- Visit Evening Study Session Thurs & Mon 6:30 - 8:30 pm to work with peers and get help from tutors

- Also ask questions on the Lab thread on Ed

## Arbuthnot

.pull-left[
**Who**: John Arbuthnot, Scottish mathematician/physician  
**When**: 1710  
**Where**: London, England  
**Why**: Try to determine the ratio of the sexes of children at birth; i.e. what is the chance that a newly born child is female?  
**How**: Collecting christening records from all of the parish churches in London.

## What is a christening record?
--

A Christening is a ceremony/rite in the Church of England where:

1. The parents bring their new born child to a priest at the church.

2. As part of the ceremony, the parents give a first name to the child before the child is baptized (inducted into the church).

3. The name of the child and their parents are recorded in a ledger.

--

John Arbuthnot tabulated the total count of names in each year that were traditionally female and male names.

## Preparing your assignment

.pull-left[
1. Create a Google Doc with your code from Tuesday

2. Add in blanks for the remaining questions

3. Submit this assignment as a pdf by 10 pm Monday

## Part I: Understanding the Context of the Data

1. What question did John Arbuthnot set out to answer in collecting this data?

2. What is the unit of observation in the original christening records? What are the possible variables that may have been recorded?

3. What do you think the probability is that a newborn child is recorded as a girl? What form of evidence or reasoning did you use to come to that determination?

# Computational Tools for Part II and III

---
## Loading Data from a Package

R packages offer a convenient way to store data.

```{r echo = TRUE}
library(palmerpenguins)
data(penguins)
```

--

```{r echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
?penguins
```

--

- Load packages with `library()`
- Load data with `data()`
- Some data comes pre-loaded and doesn't require `data()` (e.g. `mtcars`)


---
## Functions on data frames

The `tidyverse` package contains several functions used to manipulate data frames: 

* `select()` : subset columns 

--

* `arrange()` : sort rows 

--

* `mutate()` : create a new column from existing column(s)

---
# Selecting columns
--

```{r select, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
select(penguins, species, island)
```
--
```{r ref.label = "select", echo = FALSE}
```


---
# Arranging the data frame by a column
--

```{r arrange, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
arrange(penguins, bill_length_mm)
```
--
```{r ref.label = "arrange", echo = FALSE}
```

--

> You can sort in descending order by wrapping the variable name in `desc()`.

---
# Mutating a new column
--

```{r mutate, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
mutate(penguins, bill_index = bill_depth_mm + bill_length_mm)
```
--
```{r ref.label = "mutate", echo = FALSE}
```

--

> Remember that you can nest functions.

---
# Mutating a new column
--

```{r mutate2, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
select(mutate(penguins, bill_index = bill_depth_mm + bill_length_mm), bill_index)
```
--
```{r ref.label = "mutate2", echo = FALSE}
```

---
# Part II: Computing on the Data
--

- Load the `arbuthnot` data frame in the `stat20data` package.

```{r echo = TRUE}
library(stat20data)
data(arbuthnot)
```

- Work on questions 4 - 7, editing your Google Doc as you go.

```{r}
countdown::countdown(10, font_size = "1.5em")
```


---
## Your first plot
--

A template for a line plot:

```{r eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE, error = TRUE}
ggplot(DATAFRAME, aes(x = XVARIABLE, y = YVARIABLE)) +
  geom_line()
```

Where:

- `DATAFRAME` is the name of your data frame
- `XVARIABLE` is the name of the variable of that data frame that you want on the x-axis
- `YVARIABLE` is the name of the variable of that data frmae that you want on the y-axis

> These plots can be copy-and-pasted into your Google Doc by clicking on the "Export" button next to the plot in RStudio

---
## Part III: Extensions
--

How do trends in a more modern data set compare to Arbuthnot's data? Find out in the `present` data frame found in the `stat20data` package.

```{r echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
data(present)
?present
```
